## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in BeMe, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report via one of these options:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): Open a [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/security/advisories/new) on GitHub (replace `OWNER` and `REPO` with the actual org/username and repository).
2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers privately if you have their contact information.

Include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge your report and aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe. We appreciate your efforts to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.
